# How-to - reconstruct panels of Fig. S12
For this supplementary figure, we re-use the file "Stat_motif_detection.tsv" generated as part of Fig. 3.script to generate these files is (see scripts in the "Analyses/Target_IMGVR_IMGPR/PAM_detection/" folder.  
Next, we use R and the commands listed in `plot_PAM_detailed.R` to generate the main panel of Fig. S12.  
For the specific motifs on the right side, the list is taken from the file "Detailed_stats_motifs.tsv", in the same "Analyses/Target_IMGVR_IMGPR/PAM_detection/" folder.
