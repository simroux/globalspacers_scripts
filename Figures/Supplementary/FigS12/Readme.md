# How-to - reconstruct panels of Fig. S12
For this supplementary figure, we re-use two files generated as part of Fig. 3: "Summary_PAM_detection_by_spacer.tsv" and "Summary_PAM_detection_by_type.tsv". The script to generate these files is `clean_up_and_summarize_array_PAM_stats.pl` in the "Main/Fig_3/" folder.  
Next, we use R and the commands listed in `plot_PAM_detailed.R` to generate the 3 panels of Fig. S12.
